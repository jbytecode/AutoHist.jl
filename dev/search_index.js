Returns a StatsBase.Histogram object with the optimal partition corresponding to the supplied rule.\n\nArguments\n\nx: 1D vector of data for which a histogram is to be constructed.\n\nKeyword arguments\n\nrule: The criterion used to determine the optimal number of bins. Defaults to the Bayesian method of Simensen et al. (2025).\ngrid: String indicating how the finest possible mesh should be constructed. Options are \"data\", which uses each unique data point as a grid point, \"regular\" (default) which constructs a fine regular grid, and \"quantile\" which constructs the grid based on the sample quantiles.\nright: Boolean indicating whether the drawn intervals should be right-inclusive or not. Defaults to true.\ngreedy: Boolean indicating whether or not the greedy binning strategy of Rozenholc et al. (2006) should be used prior to running the dynamical programming algorithm. Defaults to true. The algorithm can be quite slow for large datasets when this keyword is set to false.\nmaxbins: The maximal number of bins to be considered by the optimization criterion, only used if grid is set to \"regular\" or \"quantile\". Defaults to maxbins=min(4*n/log(n)^2, 1000). If the specified argument is not a positive integer, the default value is used.\nsupport: Tuple specifying the the support of the histogram estimate. If the first element is -Inf, then minimum(x) is taken as the leftmost cutpoint. Likewise, if the second elemen is Inf, then the rightmost cutpoint is maximum(x). Default value is (-Inf, Inf), which estimates the support of the data.\nuse_min_length: Boolean indicating whether or not to impose a restriction on the minimum bin length of the histogram. If set to true, the smallest allowed bin length is set to (maximum(x)-minimum(x))/n*log(n)^(1.5).\nlogprior: Unnormalized logprior distribution for the number k of bins. Defaults to a uniform prior. Only used in when rule=\"bayes\".\na: Dirichlet concentration parameter in the Bayesian irregular histogram model. Set to the default value (5.0) if the supplied value is not a positive real number. Only used when rule=\"bayes\".\n\nReturns\n\nH: StatsBase.Histogram object with weights corresponding to densities, e.g. :isdensity is set to true.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> x = [0.037, 0.208, 0.189, 0.656, 0.45, 0.846, 0.986, 0.751, 0.249, 0.447]\njulia> H1 = histogram_irregular(x)\njulia> H2 = histogram_irregular(x; grid=\"quantile\", support=(0.0, 1.0), logprior=k->-log(k), a=sqrt(10))\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"api/#AutoHist.histogram_regular","page":"API","title":"AutoHist.histogram_regular","text":"histogram_regular(x::AbstractVector{<:Real}; rule::Str=\"bayes\", right::Bool=true, maxbins::Int=1000, support::Tuple{Real,Real}=(-Inf,Inf), logprior::Function=k->0.0, a::Union{Real,Function}=1.0)\n\nCreate a regular histogram based on optimization criterion from Bayesian probability, penalized likelihood or LOOCV.

Likewise, if the second element is Inf, then the rightmost cutpoint is maximum(x).

Only used in the case where the supplied rule is \"bayes\". Defaults to a uniform prior.\na: Specifies Dirichlet concentration parameter in the Bayesian histogram model. Can either be a fixed positive number or a function computing aₖ for different values of k. Defaults to 1.0 if not supplied.
